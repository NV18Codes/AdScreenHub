- Shows message: "Verification email sent successfully! Check your inbox and click the verification link to verify your email."

### **Step 3: Email Verification**

- User clicks verification link

**For Production (Netlify):**
- Goes directly to production email verification page
- Verifies email with real API
- Redirects to signup page with success message

**For Development (Localhost):**
- Goes to production URL first
- **Automatic redirect** to `http://localhost:3002/email-verification`
- Verifies email with real API
- Redirects to signup page with success message

### **Step 4: Return to Signup with Email Verified**
- User is redirected to `/signup?email=...&verified=true`

- Phone number field becomes enabled

### **Step 5: Enter Phone Number & Get OTP**
- User enters 10-digit phone number
- Clicks "Send OTP" button
- **Real API call** to `https://adscreenapi-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/start-phone-verification`
- **Real SMS sent** to user's phone
- Shows OTP input fields
- Shows message: "OTP sent to your phone number. Please check your SMS."

### **Step 6: Verify OTP**
- User enters 6-digit OTP from SMS
- Clicks "Verify OTP" button
- **Real API call** to `https://adscreenapi-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/verify-phone`
- If successful, shows success message
- Phone field shows "âœ“ Verified" status

### **Step 7: Complete Registration**
- After phone verification, user is redirected to `/complete-profile`
- User completes profile with full name, address, etc.
- Final registration is completed

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Email Verification Flow**
```javascript
// EmailVerification.jsx
if (isProductionUrl && (emailFromParams || tokenFromParams)) {
  // Auto-redirect from production to localhost for development
  const localhostUrl = `http://localhost:3002/email-verification?email=...&token=...`;
  window.location.href = localhostUrl;
}

// After successful verification
navigate(`/signup?email=${emailToVerify}&verified=true`);
```

### **Signup Page Flow**
```javascript
// Signup.jsx
// Check if returning from email verification
const isFromEmailVerification = searchParams.get('verified') === 'true';
if (isFromEmailVerification) {
  setVerificationState(prev => ({ ...prev, emailVerified: true }));
  setMessages(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    email: 'âœ“ Email verified successfully! Now please verify your phone number.' 
  }));
}
```

### **Phone Verification Flow**
```javascript
// After phone OTP verification
const handlePhoneVerificationSuccess = () => {
  localStorage.setItem('verified_phone', formData.phoneNumber);
  navigate(`/complete-profile?email=${formData.email}&phone=${formData.phoneNumber}`);
};
```
