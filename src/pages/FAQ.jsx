            <h3>1. What elements are allowed as the ad?</h3>
            <p>Your digital screen ad would be either:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>An image</li>

            <p>
              Yes, each location has unique dimensions, aspect ratios, and orientations. To ensure your ad displays
              perfectly and avoids delays or rejection, creatives must meet the exact specifications with high

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>6. What is the length and frequency of the ad?</h3>
            <p>
              The duration of an ad is typically 10-second showing of your advertisement on a digital screen.
              Typically, digital screens operate for about 14 hours daily, and your ad is displayed repeatedly—once
              every minute or every one and a half minute—on one digital screen within your selected target area.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>7. Where will my ad be displayed?</h3>
            <p>
              Your ad would appear on one large LED digital screen in a high-sensitive traffic area based on your
              selected target location.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>8. When will my ad be displayed?</h3>
            <p>Your ad would appear on the digital screen from 8am to 10pm on the chosen day(s).</p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>9. How do I choose where my ad will be displayed?</h3>
            <p>
              When creating your campaign, simply choose your target location from the suggested options. Your
              ad will then appear on the digital screen, providing focused local coverage based on availability of the
              selected date.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>10. Can I run my ad in multiple locations at the same time?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes! You'll need to create a separate order for each location as each location has its own availability,
              size, dimensions, and orientation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>11. Can I change my ad or creative after the order?</h3>
            <p>
              Once your campaign is live, changes to the ad or creative aren't possible. Since every creative must go
              through a strict approval process, making modifications mid-campaign could cause delays or rejection.
              To ensure your ad runs smoothly and on time, please upload your final creative before completing the
              order.

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>15. Why is ad approval necessary?</h3>
            <p>
              Ad approval helps guarantee that your advertisement aligns with local laws, governmental regulations
              and community standards. Certain locations have specific restrictions—for example, ads on specific
              days are restricted by governmental regulations. This review process ensures your ad is appropriate
              and eligible for display.
            </p>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>16. What are my responsibilities regarding the content of my advertisements?</h3>
            <p>
              You are responsible for ensuring that your advertisement content is not misleading and complies with
              all applicable laws, regulations, and ethical standards. Failure to meet these requirements may result
              in your ad being rejected or your account being terminated. In addition, in accordance to the Bruhat
              Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Bye-Laws, 2018, the text/logo
              (units) in digital screen must adhere to the ratio of 60:40 of Kannada language : secondary language
              (English).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>17. What happens if my ad gets rejected?</h3>
            <p>
              If your ad doesn't meet the required guidelines, you'll receive an email outlining the issues. You may
              need to update the content, such as adjusting images or text, to comply with regulations. Once revised,
              you can resubmit your ad for another review. However, the revised ad must be resubmitted at least 12
              hours before the scheduled start time of the relevant ad slot.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3>18. What happens if I don't resubmit my revised advertisement?</h3>
            <p>
              If you fail to resubmit the corrected advertisement, the ad slot will be forfeited. In such cases, you will
              not be entitled to any refund, credit, or compensation.

            <h3>19. What if I need to make changes but there is less than 12 hours before my ad slot starts?</h3>
            <p>
              It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with all advertisement guidelines during order
              placements. In such cases, the ad slot will be forfeited, and you will remain liable for the full charges

              all guidelines. Only compliant advertisements will be displayed.

            <h3>24. How do power cuts affect my ad display and billing?</h3>
            <p>
              While Bengaluru may experience occasional power cuts, it's important to note that power
              interruptions can still occur due to various factors such as maintenance activities, infrastructure issues,
              or unforeseen circumstances. Our LED screens typically operate for about 14 hours daily, offering
              around 840 ad slots each day. Based on the latest report related to BESCOM, the average daily power
              outage is approximately 2.2 hours. To account for this, we charge only for 700 slots per day, reflecting
              typical screen availability.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event of a power outage exceeding the average duration, such occurrence shall be deemed a
              force majeure event beyond the reasonable control of AdScreenHub, and AdScreenHub shall not be
              held liable for any failure or delay in the display of advertisements arising therefrom. Conversely, if
              there are no power interruptions, you'll benefit from additional ad slots beyond the 700 daily
              allotment at no extra charge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note, according to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (Advertisement) Bye-Laws, 2024,
              applicable to Greater Bengaluru Area under the Greater Bengaluru Governance Act, 2024, digital
              screens are not allowed to use diesel generators to operate during power outages.
